*game controls*
space bar attacks, up is jump. Other than that the game auto scrolls and you have to either attack or jump over the saw blades. There is a lot more I was working on but didnt get to it in time. I may have been over complicating it by implementing the MVC design.

*Notes*
I'm going to keep working on it because its clearly not finished. I was just beginning to implement the opponents and wanted to make the character fully controlled by the player instead of having the auto-running feature. I ended up losing my whole project last night right before it was due because of a corrupted USB drive, so i've spent the last 24 hours hammering this out. Its far from done.
